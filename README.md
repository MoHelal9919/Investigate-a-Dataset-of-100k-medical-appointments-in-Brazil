# Investigate-a-Dataset-of-100k-medical-appointments-in-Brazil#
In this project,  i analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. i will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.
<p>A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row:</p>
<li> ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
<li> ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
<li> ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
<li> Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.!
